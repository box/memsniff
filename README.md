# Memsniff

[![Project Status](http://opensource.box.com/badges/active.svg)](http://opensource.box.com/badges)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/box/memsniff.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/box/memsniff)[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/box/memsniff)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/box/memsniff)

Memsniff displays the busiest keys being retrieved from your memcache server.
It has been inspired by the earlier [mctop](https://github.com/etsy/mctop) and
[memkeys](https://github.com/tumblr/memkeys) tools.

Like its predecessors, memsniff listens to network traffic and identifies
responses to `get` requests, and is usually run directly on a memcache server
host.

You can see our announcement
[here](https://blog.box.com/blog/introducing-memsniff-robust-memcache-traffic-analyzer/).


## Installation

Before building you'll need to have the libpcap library and headers installed.

On Redhat-based distributions:

```shell
# yum install libpcap-devel
```

Or on Debian-based distributions:

```shell
# apt-get update && apt-get install libpcap-dev
```

Memsniff uses the
[standard golang toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install),
which makes installation simple.
Once you have the toolchain installed and `$GOPATH` pointed to your working
directory:

```shell
$ go get github.com/box/memsniff
$ go build github.com/box/memsniff
```

You will find a compiled binary at `$GOPATH/bin/memsniff`,
ready to be transferred to your Memcache
hosts or packaged in your distribution's preferred format.


## Usage

On most operating systems `memsniff` requires superuser privileges to capture
network traffic from an interface, which you specify with the `-i` option.

```shell
# memsniff -i eth0
```

See `-h` for more command-line options.  Once running a few more keys are
active:

* `p` - Pause the updating of the display. Press `p` again to resume.
* `q` - Exit `memsniff`.


## Roadmap

* Support binary memcached protocol
* Support additional operations beyond GET
* Support alternate sorting methods
* Create a stable report format for output to disk
* Automatic logging to disk when specified conditions are met (e.g. aggregate
  or single key traffic exceeds a threshold)
* Break out traffic by client IP
* Supply build support for common package formats (`.deb`, `.rpm`, &hellip;)


## Developing memsniff

Want to contribute? First have a look at
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/box/memsniff/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Running the tests

`memsniff` uses the standard Go testing framework:

```shell
$ go test ./...
?   	github.com/box/memsniff	[no test files]
...
ok  	github.com/box/memsniff/vendor/github.com/spf13/pflag	0.067s
```


#### Data pipeline

1. Raw packets are captured on the main thread from `libpcap` using
   [GoPacket](https://www.github.com/google/gopacket).
2. Batches of raw packets are sent to the decode pool, where workers parse the
   memcached protocol looking for responses to `get` requests.  The key and
   size of the value returned are extracted into a response summary.
3. Batches of response summaries are sent to the analysis pool where the stream
   is hash partitioned by cache key and sent to workers. Each worker maintains
   a hotlist of the busiest keys in its hash partition.
4. In response to periodic requests from the UI, the analysis pool merges
   reports from all its workers into a single sorted hotlist, which is
   displayed to the user.
